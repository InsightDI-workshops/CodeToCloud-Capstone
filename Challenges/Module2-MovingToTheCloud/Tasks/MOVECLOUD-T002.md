# Running containers in a cluster
Our cluster and database are running and the DevOps team has successfully automated the deployment of these Azure Resources. Now it is time to start running the application in the cloud. The container have already been pushed to the GitHub Container Registry so they can get started with the cluster right away.

## Challenge

## Validation
* Web site showing data from the API
* API showing data from the CosmosDB
