# Storyline

Everything is going right into production. Some customers complain about untested updates, unknown behavior. ALthough CI/CD is great we need to have more control about what is moving to production and we want to have a test environment

# challenge
* Add environment in Helm chart
* Deploy to new namespace
* setup extra stage with approval in Release Pipeline
