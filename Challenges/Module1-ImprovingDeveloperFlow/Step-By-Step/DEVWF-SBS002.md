## Step by Step DEVWF-T001

2. Type the following command to create a Docker network named `fabmedical`:

   ```bash
   docker network create fabmedical
   ```

3. Run an instance of mongodb to use for local testing.

   ```bash
   docker container run --name mongo --net fabmedical -p 27017:27017 -d mongo
   ```

   > **Note**:  With the existing source code written for MongoDB, it can be pointed towards the Azure Cosmos DB MongoDB API endpoint. The Azure Cosmos DB Emulator could be used for local development on Windows, however, the Cosmos DB emulator does not support Linux. As a result, when using Linux for development, MongoDB is still needed for local development environments; with Azure Cosmos DB used for data storage in the cloud. This allows existing source code written for MongoDB storage to be easily migrated to using Azure Cosmos DB backend.

4. Confirm that the mongo container is running and ready.

   ```bash
   docker container list
   docker container logs mongo
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console window, docker container list has been typed and run at the command prompt, and the “api” container is in the list. Below this the log output is shown.](/assets/Ex1-Task1.4.png)

5. Connect to the mongo instance using the mongo shell and test some basic commands:

   ```bash
   mongo
   ```

   ```text
   show dbs
   quit()
   ```

   ![This screenshot of the console window shows the output from connecting to mongo.](/assets/Ex1-Task1.5.png)

6. To initialize the local database with test content, first navigate to the content-init directory and run npm install.

   ```bash
   cd ~/Fabmedical/content-init
   npm install
   ```

   > **Note**: In some cases, the `root` user will be assigned ownership of your user's `.config` folder. If this happens, run the following command to return ownership to `adminfabmedical` and then try `npm install` again:

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /home/adminfabmedical/.config
   ```

7. Initialize the database.

   ```bash
   nodejs server.js
   ```

   ![This screenshot of the console window shows output from running the database initialization.](/assets/Ex1-Task1.7.png)

8. Confirm that the database now contains test data.

   ```bash
   mongo
   ```

   ```text
   show dbs
   use contentdb
   show collections
   db.speakers.find()
   db.sessions.find()
   quit()
   ```

   This should produce output similar to the following:

   ![This screenshot of the console window shows the data output.](/assets/Ex1-Task1.8.png)

9. Now navigate to the `content-api` directory and run npm install.

   ```bash
   cd ../content-api
   npm install
   ```

   > **Note**: In some cases, the `root` user will be assigned ownership of your user's `.config` folder. If this happens, run the following command to return ownership to `adminfabmedical` and then try `npm install` again:

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /home/adminfabmedical/.config
   ```

10. Start the API as a background process.

    ```bash
    nodejs ./server.js &
    ```

    ![In this screenshot, nodejs ./server.js & has been typed and run at the command prompt, which starts the API as a background process.](/assets/image47.png)

11. Press ENTER again to get to a command prompt for the next step.

12. Test the API using curl. You will request the speaker's content, and this will return a JSON result.

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3001/speakers
    ```

    ![In this screenshot, made a curl request to view speakers.](/assets/image47_1.png)

13. Navigate to the web application directory, run `npm install` and `ng build`.

    ```bash
    cd ../content-web
    npm install
    ng build
    ```

    ![In this screenshot, after navigating to the web application directory, nodejs ./server.js & has been typed and run at the command prompt, which runs the application as a background process as well.](/assets/image48.png)

    > **Note**: In some cases, the `root` user will be assigned ownership of your user's `.config` folder. If this happens, run the following command to return ownership to `adminfabmedical` and then try `npm install` again:

    ```bash
    sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /home/adminfabmedical/.config
    ```

14. From Azure cloud shell, run the following command to find the IP address for the build agent VM provisioned when you ran the ARM deployment.

    ```bash
    az vm show -d -g fabmedical-[SUFFIX] -n fabmedical-[SHORT_SUFFIX] --query publicIps -o tsv
    ```

    Example:

    ```bash
    az vm show -d -g fabmedical-sol -n fabmedical-SOL --query publicIps -o tsv
    ```

15. From the cloud shell in the build machine edit the `app.js` file using vim.

    ```bash
    vim app.js
    ```

    Then press **_i_** to get into the edit mode, after that replace localhost with the build machine IP address.

    ![Show the app.js file in vim in the build machine to update the API URL.](/assets/image27.png)

    Then press **_ESC_**, write **_:wq_** to save you changes and close the file.

16. Now run the content-web application in the background.

    ```bash
    node ./app.js &
    ```

    Press `ENTER` again to get a command prompt for the next step.

17. Test the web application using curl. You will see HTML output returned without errors.

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3000
    ```

18. Leave the application running for the next task.

19. If you received a JSON response to the /speakers content request and an HTML response from the web application, your environment is working as expected.
