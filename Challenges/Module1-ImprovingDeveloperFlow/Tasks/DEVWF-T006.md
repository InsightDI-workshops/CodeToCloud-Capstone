# Setting up a local infrastrcuture

Now that the web api is running. Only the web api needs to transform as well. For that a developer created a docker file as well, that can be found in the PR XXX (@@@). 

But runnign all the containers separately is nt conventiet. It takes a lot of setup. One of the devs finds docker-compse that allows you to start a compostotion with one command and 1 file

# challenge
